# ODE with R

## 1D example

### Problem



Use local stability analysis on the logistic (all equilibria) and analytically calculate lambda. What is the stability response to r?
For the following Budworm model done by D. Ludwig,

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - \frac{BN^2}{N^2 + N_0}$$

 where the budworm, N, grows logistical but is consumed by a constant amount of predators (density B). Using dynamical systems theory: i) find local equilibria for K and B (assume r=1);  ii) solve for the local stability of all relevant equilibria as a function of budworm carrying capacity, K, and the predator density, B. What bifurcations do we expect and when?

Hint: for insight it may help to do this graphically (and produce code dN/dt to check) consider the growth function (logistic term: rN(1-N/K)) and the mortality function (– BN2/(N2+No)) separately (i.e., note that where the growth function crosses the mortality function we have equilibria: plotting N versus these rates or terms of F(N) may therefore be useful).






### Expanding the equation

Non trivial equilibrium:

$$rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) = \frac{BN^2}{N^2 + N_0}$$

or simply:

$$r\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) = \frac{BN}{N^2 + N_0}$$

this yields:

$$-\frac{r}{K}N^3 + rN^2 + \left(r\frac{N_0}{K}-B\right)N - rN_0 = 0$$

let's divide by $\frac{r}{K}$:

$$-N^3 + KN^2 + \left(N_0-K\frac{B}{r}\right)N - KN_0 = 0$$

Assuming $r = 1$, $K = 10$, Below are shown this curve for station


```{r}
library(latex2exp)
seqN <- seq(-2, 12, .1)
pol <- function(N, r, K, B, N0) {
  if (!B) {
    # attack term does not exits
    out <- K*N-N*N
  }  else {
    if (!N0) {
      out <- K*N-N*N - B
    } else out <- -N^3 + K*N*N + (N0-K*(B/r))*N + - K*N0
  }
  out
}
##
cust_plot <- function(seqN, r, K, B, N0, main) {
  plot(seqN, pol(seqN, r, K, B, N0), type = "l", lwd = 2,
  main = main, xlab = "N", ylab = TeX("\\dot{N}"))
  abline(h=0, v=c(0,10), lty=2)
}

cust_plot(seqN, -1, 10, 0, 0, main = "B = 0")
cust_plot(seqN, -1, 10, 10, 0, main = "B = 5; N0 = 0")
cust_plot(seqN, -1, 10, 1, 2, main = "B = 1; N0 = 2")
cust_plot(seqN, -1, 10, 1, 4, main = "B = 1; N0 = 4")
cust_plot(seqN, -1, 10, 1, 8, main = "B = 1; N0 = 8")
```

## Homemade approach

## ODE with `desolve`

[deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html) package
is commonly used to solve ODE. I recommend you started by looking at the vignettes

- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/vignettes/compiledCode.pdf
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/vignettes/deSolve.pdf




## ODE with `odeintr`

[`odeint`](http://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/) is a C++ library, Timothy H. Keitt (may be a name familiar to some of you)
has created a R package that wrapps around this library: [odeintr](https://github.com/thk686/odeintr).

Example from the GitHub project page:


```{r}
library(odeintr)
dxdt = function(x, t) c(x[1] - x[1] * x[2], x[1] * x[2] - x[2])
obs = function(x, t) c(Prey = x[1], Predator = x[2], Ratio = x[1] / x[2])
system.time({x = integrate_sys(dxdt, rep(2, 2), 20, 0.01, observer = obs)})
plot(x[, c(2, 3)], type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "steelblue", main = "Lotka-Volterra Phase Plot")
```
