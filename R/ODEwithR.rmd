## Home=made approach

## ODE with `desolve`

[deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html) package
is commonly used to solve ODE. I recommend you started by looking at the vignettes

## ODE with `odeintr`

[`odeint`](http://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/) is a C++ library, Timothy H. Keitt (may be a name familiar to some of you)
has created a R package that wrapps around this library: [odeintr](https://github.com/thk686/odeintr).

Example from the GitHub project page:


```{r}
library(odeintr)
dxdt = function(x, t) c(x[1] - x[1] * x[2], x[1] * x[2] - x[2])
obs = function(x, t) c(Prey = x[1], Predator = x[2], Ratio = x[1] / x[2])
system.time({x = integrate_sys(dxdt, rep(2, 2), 20, 0.01, observer = obs)})
plot(x[, c(2, 3)], type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "steelblue", main = "Lotka-Volterra Phase Plot")
```
