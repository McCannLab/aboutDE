## Few notes about the history



## Choose your computational tools

Among others:

- Julia: http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/

- Octave: https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.3/Ordinary-Differential-Equations.html

- Python: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html

- Rust: https://docs.rs/GSL/0.4.26/rgsl/types/ordinary_differential_equations/index.html

- FORTRAN C/C++


### R

- R: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/odeintr


### ODE with `desolve`

[deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html) package
is commonly used to solve ODE. I recommend you start by looking at the vignettes
